I learned C++ in 8 weeks as part of my data science course at Centrale. Since our C++ practical work was very long, I consider them as mini-projects in themselves. In each file is my code and a correction. The difficulty of the practical work is progressive, from the basics to threads and templates. I would be very curious to apply my C++ skills to a data science project requiring high performance and to learn more about this program language.
